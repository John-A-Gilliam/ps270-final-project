## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to a couple of different things. I think a project centered around data from my home state
of New York would be interesting, probably around the recent mayoral election. Another topic I would be interested in working with is 
maybe some data on area codes and seeing if there are voting trends based on area codes according to different factors like poverty level, race, or education. I think broadly I want to work with election data of some sort, but I could also be open to looking at economic data with counties and see how those affects may impact their urban and community planning.
